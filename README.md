# 🍒 Cherry on Top!

by Erin Luz & Sofia Triguero of 9 - Cesium

## ✍️ Description
Cherry on Top is an online game designed to give users the experience of being a baker decorating pastries for customers. This website features various options allowing players to choose between designing an ice cream or a cake. 

The player is first welcomed through the homepage wherein the simple game mechanics are presented. Next, they select an apron of their choice. After, they choose between decorating an ice cream or a cake for the customer. If the player selects a cake, they will be able to select the shape of the cake, the number of tiers the cake will have, and the flavor of the cake. Additional topics and decorations can soon be added after the player finalizes the cake’s shape, tiers, and flavor. If the player selects an ice cream, they will be able to select its type of cone or cup, number of scoops, and flavor. After this is decided, the player may decorate the ice cream and proceed to serve it to the customer.

## 🧑‍💻 Incorporation of JavaScript 
homepage.html: On the homepage of our bakery website, Cherry on Top, JavaScript can be used to create an interactive experience for the user wherein clicking the "Enter" or “Start” button triggers the bakery background music to start playing. We can achieve this with the help of if-else statements. The music will only begin once the user presses the button and will only end once the user finishes the game or exits the website. Our code will also include an event listener which waits for the user to click the button, and then plays the MP3 file of the background music. This sets the bakery game’s vibe and will ultimately grab the user’s attention and encourage them to continue playing.
